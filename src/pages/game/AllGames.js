All Games Page
URL structure - /games

We need a way for players to manage and see all their games.  On the all games page, you will need to show 5 sections pieces of information:
Open Games: a list of all games that have been started by OTHER players.  Include a link to the start page, a button to join (and then redirect) to the game page
My Open Games: a list of all the games that the logged in player has started but no one else has joined.  Make sure to show the start time and a link to the game page.
My Active Games: a list of all the games that have a second player.  Include the name of the opponent, a link
My Completed Games: include a list of all the games that the current user ONLY has participated in.  Include a link to the game page, the name of the opponent, the start/end time and whether the active player has won or not.
Other Games: include all active games or completed games that the active is NOT part of.  Include a link to that game page, the start time and the 2 active users.  If the game is completed, show the end time and indicate who won the game.

If a logged in user goes to this page, they should just see all the games in 2 sections:
Active games: games that are currently ongoing and have 2 players.  Please list the players participating in the game and the time/date that the game started.
Completed games: games that are now over.  Please display the participating players, the winner of the game, the start time and the end time.
